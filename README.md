Alternatively, you can install this collection from your Postman client by directly downloading the .zip file, selecting "Import," and dropping in the .json file. 

## Step 1: Obtain API credentials
Before you can start making Commerce API requests, you'll need to contact Digital River to obtain a test key. After getting your key, you can begin to make test calls to the API. 

To start the process of getting a test key, go to the [Request Demo page](https://www.digitalriver.com/request-demo/) and request a test API key in the "Tell Us More" section. From there, Digital River will reach out to get you your key in 1-2 days. 

## Step 2: Perform a test request
In Postman, open Get Product ID from List request and include the `product.id` in the query parameters. 
A successful response contains the data for the specified `product.id`.
