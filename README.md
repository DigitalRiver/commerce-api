Alternatively, you can install this collection from your Postman client by directly downloading the .zip file, selecting "Import," and dropping in the .json file. 

## Step 1: Obtain API credentials
Before you can start making Commerce API requests, you'll need to contact Digital River to obtain a test key. After getting your key, you can begin to make test calls to the API. 

To start the process of getting a test key, go to the [Request Demo page](https://www.digitalriver.com/request-demo/) and request a test API key in the "Tell Us More" section. From there, Digital River will reach out to get you your key in 1-2 days. 

If you already have a Global Commerce account, you can use your secret test key to begin making API calls as well. 

## Step 2: Perform a test request
In Postman, open Create a physical sku request.

In the body of the request, use the id object to specify a unique identifier for the SKU and click Send. 

A successful response contains a value for the id attribute that matches the one in the request body.
